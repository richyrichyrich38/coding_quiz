#Code-Quiz
This is a timed quiz that tests knowledge of Javascript basics

##Installation
To create this quiz, HTML, CSS and Javascript was used.

The process moves as follows; once you start the quiz the countdown timer starts immediately and you are presented with 4 options to choose from, choose correctly and you will move onto the next question with a visual and audio notification letting you know your choice was correct! If you get it wrong, you still move onto the next question but you receive a visual and audio notification informing you that you're incorrect but this time you also lose 10 seconds of time, and your final time is your final score so you better choose wisely!

If you complete the quiz with time to spare than you are congratulated, shown your final score and asked to submit your initials which are stored on local and can be seen by clicking the highscore link in the top left corner along with your previous successful attempts.
